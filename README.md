# Voter ID Extraction

This project focuses on extracting voter ID data from PDF documents. The extracted data can be used for analysis, verification, or other purposes. The project utilizes Python libraries like EacyOCR, PIL, and ImageIO for accurate data extraction. The extracted data is stored in a SQL Server database using SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- EacyOCR library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- ImageIO library
- SQL Server
- SQLAlchemy
- PyMySQL
